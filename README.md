## Hola ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan Valero, mathematician and data expert. I love to listen and learn about music, make radio shows and traveling by bicycle.

### Audio & Music Projects
- I am building [deepdiggin](https://github.com/jvaleroliet/deepdiggin), a deep learning application that accurately classifies vinyl records condition based on audio analysis, utilizing the Goldmine Grading Standard. Demo + info of the project can be found [here](https://jvaleroliet.github.io/projects/deepdiggin/).

- I made an in-depth analysis of my 14 (!) years of Spotify listening habits, revealing my personal music preferences and consumption patterns over time. All the info is on my [portfolio](https://jvaleroliet.github.io/projects/spotify_data/), with ML-created-playlists, and you can recreate it for your music history by cloning this [repo](https://github.com/jvaleroliet/spotify-analysis).

- I have a musical project called [Sono Mayrit](https://sonomayrit.xyz). The page is build in markdown and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/jvaleroliet/sonomayrit).


### Python Tools
- I am collaborator of [pykobo](https://github.com/pvernier/pykobo) and I created the first version for the previous API, still available on the repo [pykobo_legacy](https://github.com/jvaleroliet/pykobo_legacy)
  
- I created [datosgobes](https://github.com/jvaleroliet/datosgobes), a python libray to manage data from Spain's [open data portal](https://datos.gob.es/es/) easily.
